BACKSTORY
So you just downloaded privsepd and you want to start protecting your code.
Unfortunately the concept of privilege separation is completely foreign to you
and you'd like to some hands on examples to get you started.

This directory gives you a humorous take on privilege separation, based on the
thing that should be common sense to most: romantic engagements.

It would be expected for a man to be faithful to his wife and produce children
with her, although it does happen that a man takes a little something on the
side. Although morally wrong it's not forbidden.
But be warned: never let the wife and mistress meet, or there'll be hell to pay.

Unfortunately some men don't stop with the mistress, but with the help of
privsepd we make this encounter impossible.

LAYOUT
To set up your family we build a small family tree in world, where wife,
daughter, and mistress live. In these classes would be loaded they could
interact inhibited with one another.
When we set up our privsepd isolation we move our family (wife and daughter)
to one privsepd instance and our mistress to another.

SETUP
To start our family make sure all dependencies for privsepd are installed.
Next build and install privsepd (or run it from within the source-tree) via the
following command:
$ sudo privsepd -dc /path/to/privsepd/example/family.conf

This starts up privsepd in the forground and show all the incoming connections
and requests.

This is sufficient to startup our normal(.php) situation and see how it helps to
protect an innocent child from the unspeakable(.php).

If you want to engage into an affair also start up mistress from another
console.
$ sudo privsepd -dc /path/to/privsepd/example/mistress.conf

This should bring our mistress into the mix and start getting unwise(.php) in
two different living quarters. In case you get stupid(.php) we'll try and
protect you again.
